For the language I choose python. For the linting I choose to use pylint since it was comprehensive linting tool for python. For testing I will run functional tests using cypress to make sure my built in features works according to their each functions. For building I will use pip to build the app. Some alternatives that can be used on CI is CircleCI, Travis CI, Gitlab CI/CD, Bitbucket Pipelines, Azure Pipelines, TeamCity, Bamboo (Atlassian), Buildkite, Semaphore CI, Appveyor, and many more. I will set on a cloud based environment. Because my application should be simple and not need many complex configuration. I also want to save cost by not building my own server. So cloud based environment should be the best.
